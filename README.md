In terms of revenue performance, the average revenue was 577.75 million, the highest sales fell in June amounting to 653 million and the lowest was 519 million which fell in July. Sales decreased in February, then increased until June.

Daily Revenue Performance shows the level of daily purchases over a period of 30 days. The average purchase rate in this case is 200 million. However, it can be obtained within a month. Here is an overview of January in 30 days.

The Top Store shows that the most purchases are in store 4, which is 860 million. Then followed by store 3 of 839 million and store 9 of 791 million.

The Category shows the number of purchases per category, the category that provides the highest purchases, namely in category 5 of 20 million purchases or 22.31% of the total products sold.

**Insight :**
 there was a greater increase from February to June compared to July and subsequent months, resulting in an average outcome. Moving forward, it would be beneficial to consider various factors, such as the implementation of a new advertising campaign, that could have contributed to this difference. This can be discussed further when planning future advertising campaigns.
